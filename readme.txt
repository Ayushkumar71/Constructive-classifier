Running the Streamlit Application

This guide outlines the steps to get your machine set up and run the Streamlit application on your local device.



Prerequisites:

Python 3.6 or later: Verify your Python version by running python --version in your terminal. If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Required Libraries: The application relies on several external Python libraries. To install them, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the requirements.txt file. Then, run the following command:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



Steps:

Navigate to Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and use the cd command to navigate to the directory where the main script (ConstClassif-app.py) is located.
Run the Streamlit Application: In your terminal, execute the following command:


Bash
streamlit run ConstClassif-app.py




Access the App: A new browser tab will automatically open, typically at http://localhost:8501/. This is the default port used by Streamlit to display the application.
